Example 1: Selecting Faces Based on Normals
If you're turning your cube into a more complex shape, you can still select faces based on their normal direction. For example, if you want to select faces that are roughly parallel to the XZ plane, you can check if the normals are mostly aligned with the Z-axis.

Here's how to select faces based on their normal direction (e.g., for faces roughly parallel to the XZ plane):

python
Copy code
import bpy
import mathutils

# Ensure we're working on the correct object (e.g., a cube or complex shape)
obj = bpy.context.active_object

# Switch to Edit Mode to manipulate mesh elements
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Deselect all faces first
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')

# Get the mesh data of the object
mesh = obj.data

# Iterate through the faces and select those with normals pointing in a specific direction
for face in mesh.polygons:
    normal = face.normal
    
    # Select faces with normals pointing along the positive Z-axis (upward)
    if normal.z > 0.9:  # Normal roughly pointing up (you can adjust this threshold)
        face.select = True
    # Select faces with normals pointing along the negative Z-axis (downward)
    elif normal.z < -0.9:  # Normal roughly pointing down
        face.select = True

# Switch back to Object Mode to apply the transformation
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

# Apply the resize transformation to the selected faces
bpy.ops.transform.resize(value=(0.684261, 1, 1),
                         orient_type='GLOBAL',
                         orient_matrix=((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)),
                         orient_matrix_type='GLOBAL',
                         constraint_axis=(True, False, False),
                         mirror=True,
                         use_proportional_edit=False,
                         proportional_edit_falloff='SMOOTH',
                         proportional_size=1,
                         use_proportional_connected=False,
                         use_proportional_projected=False,
                         snap=False,
                         snap_elements={'INCREMENT'},
                         use_snap_project=False,
                         snap_target='CLOSEST',
                         use_snap_self=True,
                         use_snap_edit=True,
                         use_snap_nonedit=True,
                         use_snap_selectable=False)
Breakdown:
Normals: Each face in Blender has a normal vector that indicates the direction the face is pointing.
Threshold: The normal.z > 0.9 condition selects faces whose normals are almost exactly facing the positive Z-axis (upwards). The threshold can be adjusted to select faces with normals pointing in the desired direction, such as the negative Z-axis (normal.z < -0.9) for downward-facing faces.
