Example 2: Selecting Faces Based on Location or Distance
Another approach is to select faces based on their position or distance from a reference point (e.g., the origin). For instance, you might want to select faces that are near the top or bottom of the object based on their average center location.

Hereâ€™s an example that selects faces based on their center's location along the Z-axis:

python
Copy code
import bpy

# Ensure we're working on the correct object (e.g., a cube or complex shape)
obj = bpy.context.active_object

# Switch to Edit Mode
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Deselect all faces first
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')

# Get the mesh data of the object
mesh = obj.data

# Define a threshold for selecting top/bottom faces (e.g., distance from the origin in Z)
threshold_top = 0.9  # faces near the top (positive Z)
threshold_bottom = -0.9  # faces near the bottom (negative Z)

# Iterate through the faces and select based on their center's location along the Z-axis
for face in mesh.polygons:
    # Get the center of the face
    center = face.center
    
    # Select faces near the top or bottom of the object based on their Z position
    if center.z > threshold_top:
        face.select = True
    elif center.z < threshold_bottom:
        face.select = True

# Switch back to Object Mode
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

# Apply the resize transformation to the selected faces
bpy.ops.transform.resize(value=(0.684261, 1, 1),
                         orient_type='GLOBAL',
                         orient_matrix=((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)),
                         orient_matrix_type='GLOBAL',
                         constraint_axis=(True, False, False),
                         mirror=True,
                         use_proportional_edit=False,
                         proportional_edit_falloff='SMOOTH',
                         proportional_size=1,
                         use_proportional_connected=False,
                         use_proportional_projected=False,
                         snap=False,
                         snap_elements={'INCREMENT'},
                         use_snap_project=False,
                         snap_target='CLOSEST',
                         use_snap_self=True,
                         use_snap_edit=True,
                         use_snap_nonedit=True,
                         use_snap_selectable=False)
Breakdown:
Center Location: face.center gives the center point of each face.
Thresholds: The threshold_top and threshold_bottom variables are used to define the Z-axis bounds for selecting the top and bottom faces.
Selection: The script selects faces where the center's Z-coordinate is greater than threshold_top (for the top) or less than threshold_bottom (for the bottom).
