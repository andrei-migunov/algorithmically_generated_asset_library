Example 3: Using a Plane (Angle Threshold)
If you want to select faces based on their alignment to a specific plane (e.g., the XZ plane), you can use a dot product approach to calculate the angle between the face's normal and the normal of the desired plane.

python
Copy code
import bpy
import mathutils

# Ensure we're working on the correct object (e.g., a cube or complex shape)
obj = bpy.context.active_object

# Switch to Edit Mode
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')

# Deselect all faces first
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action='DESELECT')

# Get the mesh data of the object
mesh = obj.data

# Define a reference plane normal (XZ plane has a normal pointing along Y)
plane_normal = mathutils.Vector((0, 1, 0))  # Normal pointing along the Y-axis

# Iterate through the faces and select those that are nearly parallel to the XZ plane
for face in mesh.polygons:
    normal = face.normal
    
    # Calculate the dot product to check the alignment to the plane normal
    dot = normal.dot(plane_normal)
    
    # Select faces whose normal is within a certain angle threshold from the XZ plane
    if abs(dot) < 0.1:  # The threshold for nearly parallel to the XZ plane
        face.select = True

# Switch back to Object Mode
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')

# Apply the resize transformation to the selected faces
bpy.ops.transform.resize(value=(0.684261, 1, 1),
                         orient_type='GLOBAL',
                         orient_matrix=((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)),
                         orient_matrix_type='GLOBAL',
                         constraint_axis=(True, False, False),
                         mirror=True,
                         use_proportional_edit=False,
                         proportional_edit_falloff='SMOOTH',
                         proportional_size=1,
                         use_proportional_connected=False,
                         use_proportional_projected=False,
                         snap=False,
                         snap_elements={'INCREMENT'},
                         use_snap_project=False,
                         snap_target='CLOSEST',
                         use_snap_self=True,
                         use_snap_edit=True,
                         use_snap_nonedit=True,
                         use_snap_selectable=False)
Breakdown:
Dot Product: The dot product between two vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them. If the dot product is close to 0, the two vectors are perpendicular (i.e., the face is roughly parallel to the reference plane).
Threshold: abs(dot) < 0.1 means that the face normal is nearly perpendicular to the plane's normal, i.e., the face is roughly parallel to the XZ plane.
Conclusion
For complex shapes, it's generally better to select faces dynamically based on geometric
